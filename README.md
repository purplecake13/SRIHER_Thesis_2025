This repository contains the code and data processing pipeline for my undergraduate thesis project: Machine Learning-Driven Precision Medicine for Leukemia and Lymphoma. 

The project integrates genomic variant data, drug descriptors, and machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, SVM, Random Forest and Logistic Regression) to predict the most likely therapeutic drugs for individual mutations, using features derived from PharmGKB, dbSNP, and Ensembl.
